    "\n",
    "The **OLS regression model** has been fitted to predict **CO2 Emission Grams/Mile** based on several independent variables. Below is the analysis of the most important variables, conclusions, and the confidence in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fuel Barrels/Year**: The coefficient is **19.05**, meaning that for every additional barrel of fuel consumed per year, CO2 emissions increase by 19.05 grams per mile. This is the **strongest predictor** of CO2 emissions in the model, indicating that fuel consumption is a critical factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combined MPG**: The coefficient is **-3.04**, meaning that for every 1 unit increase in Combined MPG, CO2 emissions decrease by 3.04 grams per mile. This **strong negative correlation** shows that more fuel-efficient vehicles emit less CO2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cylinders**: The coefficient is **1.88**, meaning that for every additional cylinder, CO2 emissions increase by 1.88 grams per mile. This **positive correlation** suggests that larger engines tend to produce more CO2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Year**: The coefficient is **-0.32**, meaning that newer vehicles tend to emit less CO2, although this effect is smaller compared to fuel consumption or MPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fuel Cost/Year**: The coefficient is **0.032**, indicating that higher fuel costs are associated with higher CO2 emissions. While this relationship is positive, its impact is much less pronounced than other factors like fuel consumption or MPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{CO2 Emission Grams/Mile} = 769.89 - 0.32 \\times \\text{Year} + 1.88 \\times \\text{Cylinders} + 19.05 \\times \\text{Fuel Barrels/Year} - 3.04 \\times \\text{Combined MPG} + 0.032 \\times \\text{Fuel Cost/Year}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **Year**: The year of the vehicle\n",
    "- **Cylinders**: The number of cylinders in the engine\n",
    "- **Fuel Barrels/Year**: The fuel consumption of the vehicle (in barrels per year)\n",
    "- **Combined MPG**: The combined miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)\n",
    "- **Fuel Cost/Year**: The cost of fuel per year\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence in the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **R-squared** value of **0.981** indicates that the model explains **98.1%** of the variability in CO2 emissions. This is considered an excellent fit for the data, suggesting that the model is highly effective at predicting CO2 emissions based on the vehicle characteristics provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **p-values** for all variables are **0.000**, indicating that each variable has a statistically significant relationship with CO2 emissions at the 95% confidence level. This means that all the predictors used in the model are important in predicting CO2 emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity**: Although the model fits the data well, the **Condition Number** is **620,000**, which suggests that there may be significant multicollinearity between the independent variables. A high Condition Number indicates that the model could be unstable, and the relationships between the independent variables may be too strong, potentially affecting the accuracy of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results, **Fuel Barrels/Year** and **Combined MPG** are the most important variables in predicting **CO2 Emissions**. These variables have the strongest relationships with CO2 emissions, with fuel consumption having the greatest impact. While the model provides a high level of confidence with an **R-squared** of **0.981**, it’s important to consider that other factors not included in the model may also influence CO2 emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model suggests that increasing fuel efficiency and reducing fuel consumption are key to reducing CO2 emissions in vehicles.\n"

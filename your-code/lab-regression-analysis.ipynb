    "\n",
    "The **OLS regression model** has been fitted to predict **CO2 Emission Grams/Mile** based on several independent variables. Below is the analysis of the most important variables, conclusions, and the confidence in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fuel Barrels/Year**: The coefficient is **19.05**, meaning that for every additional barrel of fuel consumed per year, CO2 emissions increase by 19.05 grams per mile. This is the **strongest predictor** of CO2 emissions in the model, indicating that fuel consumption is a critical factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combined MPG**: The coefficient is **-3.04**, meaning that for every 1 unit increase in Combined MPG, CO2 emissions decrease by 3.04 grams per mile. This **strong negative correlation** shows that more fuel-efficient vehicles emit less CO2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cylinders**: The coefficient is **1.88**, meaning that for every additional cylinder, CO2 emissions increase by 1.88 grams per mile. This **positive correlation** suggests that larger engines tend to produce more CO2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Year**: The coefficient is **-0.32**, meaning that newer vehicles tend to emit less CO2, although this effect is smaller compared to fuel consumption or MPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fuel Cost/Year**: The coefficient is **0.032**, indicating that higher fuel costs are associated with higher CO2 emissions. While this relationship is positive, its impact is much less pronounced than other factors like fuel consumption or MPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{CO2 Emission Grams/Mile} = 769.89 - 0.32 \\times \\text{Year} + 1.88 \\times \\text{Cylinders} + 19.05 \\times \\text{Fuel Barrels/Year} - 3.04 \\times \\text{Combined MPG} + 0.032 \\times \\text{Fuel Cost/Year}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **Year**: The year of the vehicle\n",
    "- **Cylinders**: The number of cylinders in the engine\n",
    "- **Fuel Barrels/Year**: The fuel consumption of the vehicle (in barrels per year)\n",
    "- **Combined MPG**: The combined miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)\n",
    "- **Fuel Cost/Year**: The cost of fuel per year\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence in the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **R-squared** value of **0.981** indicates that the model explains **98.1%** of the variability in CO2 emissions. This is considered an excellent fit for the data, suggesting that the model is highly effective at predicting CO2 emissions based on the vehicle characteristics provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **p-values** for all variables are **0.000**, indicating that each variable has a statistically significant relationship with CO2 emissions at the 95% confidence level. This means that all the predictors used in the model are important in predicting CO2 emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity**: Although the model fits the data well, the **Condition Number** is **620,000**, which suggests that there may be significant multicollinearity between the independent variables. A high Condition Number indicates that the model could be unstable, and the relationships between the independent variables may be too strong, potentially affecting the accuracy of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results, **Fuel Barrels/Year** and **Combined MPG** are the most important variables in predicting **CO2 Emissions**. These variables have the strongest relationships with CO2 emissions, with fuel consumption having the greatest impact. While the model provides a high level of confidence with an **R-squared** of **0.981**, it’s important to consider that other factors not included in the model may also influence CO2 emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model suggests that increasing fuel efficiency and reducing fuel consumption are key to reducing CO2 emissions in vehicles.\n"

    "\n",
    "The regression model was fitted using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**, and the following key results were obtained:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R-squared: 0.932**: The model explains **93.2%** of the variability in the dependent variable **Y** (Number of People Attended). This indicates that the model provides a strong fit for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjusted R-squared: 0.920**: This adjusted value accounts for the number of predictors in the model. It confirms that the model still explains a significant portion of the variance after considering the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F-statistic: 81.81** and **Prob (F-statistic): 0.000102**: The very low p-value for the F-statistic indicates that the model as a whole is statistically significant. In other words, the independent variable **X** (Number of People Invited) significantly explains the variation in the dependent variable **Y** (Number of People Attended).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coefficients**:\n",
    "  - **Intercept (const)**: -0.4394. The intercept represents the expected value of **Y** when **X** is zero. While the intercept is statistically insignificant (with a high p-value of **0.584**), it is included for the regression equation.\n",
    "  - **Slope (X)**: 0.8485. For each additional person invited, the number of people who attend increases by approximately **0.85**. The slope is statistically significant, as shown by the very low p-value (**0.000**).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard errors** and **t-statistics**: These values show the precision of the coefficient estimates. The **t-statistics** are quite high for both the intercept and slope, indicating that the coefficients are estimated with good precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P-values**:\n",
    "  - **P>|t| for X**: 0.000, which indicates that the number of people invited (**X**) is statistically significant in predicting the number of people who attend.\n",
    "  - **P>|t| for const**: 0.584, indicating that the intercept term is not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Durbin-Watson statistic: 1.867**: This value is close to 2, indicating that there is no significant autocorrelation in the residuals, meaning the errors are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Skew and Kurtosis**: The **skew** value of **0.261** indicates a slight positive skew, while the **kurtosis** value of **1.873** suggests the distribution is slightly flatter than a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UserWarning**: The warning related to the **kurtosistest** is due to the small sample size (n=8), which is less than the recommended 20 data points. This warning can be ignored in this context, but it highlights that the results may not be as robust due to the small sample.\n",

    "The regression results show a **strong positive linear relationship** between the number of people invited and the number of people who attended the party. **X (number of people invited)** is a statistically significant predictor of **Y (number of people attended)**. However, due to the small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution.\n"

    "1. **Improved Model Fit**: The updated model's **R-squared** value increased from **0.932** to **0.943**. This indicates that the regression model now explains **94.3%** of the variability in the data, which is a substantial improvement, suggesting that the removal of **Point (X = 14)** helped the model fit the data better.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Slope**: The **slope of the updated model (0.6842)** is slightly higher than the original model, indicating that after removing the influential point, the relationship between the number of people invited and the number of people attending became more pronounced. For every additional person invited, the number of attendees increases by approximately **0.6842** instead of the previous estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **More Reliable Predictions**: With the removal of **Point (X = 14)**, the model has become more reliable. The regression line now fits the remaining data more appropriately, and the overall statistical significance of the model has improved, as shown by the higher **Adjusted R-squared** and the significant **p-value** for the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on the Graphs:\n",
    "- The **scatter plot with the regression line** after removing **Point (X = 14)** shows a more consistent linear trend in the data. The line no longer seems distorted by an extreme point.\n",
    "- The **residual plot** and **standardized residuals** also confirm that the model without the problematic point better adheres to the assumptions of linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "By removing **Point (X = 14)**, we significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of the regression model. The data appears to have a **strong linear relationship** between the number of people invited and the number of people who attended. The updated model provides better predictions and insights for future analyses.\n",

    "This final model can now be used to make more confident predictions about the relationship between these two variables.\n"
